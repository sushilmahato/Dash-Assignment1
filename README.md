# Dash-Assignment1

The Dataset that is used here is GapMinder Dataset, can be downloaded from  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminderDataFiveYear.csv" .

Here we have created a web page using Dash to manipulate and view the dataset

● We have considered 4 columns of the Dataset i.e. Country, Continent, Population and Life expectancy.

● The dataset table is filterable hence it consists of two drop downs and 2 range sliders and below that
there is download button which helps to download the filterable data into csv file.
